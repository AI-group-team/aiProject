DESCRIOTION ABOUT THE CODE

This Python code prompts the user to enter a string and then counts the frequency of each character in the string. The program uses a dictionary called char_count to store the count of each character. If a character is encountered more than once, the count is incremented. If the character is encountered for the first time, the count is initialized to 1.

The program then iterates through the dictionary and prints out the character count for each character in the format "count character's".
