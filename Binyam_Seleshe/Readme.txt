Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game implemented in Python. The game includes a basic AI algorithm that randomly selects a move for the computer player.


Requirements

This game requires Python 3 and the Tkinter library.


Usage

To play the game, run the game.py file in a Python interpreter:
The game will open in a window. Click on the "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" button to select your move. The game will then execute the AI algorithm and determine the winner. 
The result will be displayed in a label. Click on the "Play again" button to reset the game and play again.

Implementation

The game is implemented using a combination of basic Python functions and the Tkinter library for the user interface. The play_game function determines the winner based on the
traditional rules of rock, paper, scissors.The ai_move function uses the random library to select a move for the computer player.
The user interface is implemented using the Tkinter library. The GameGUI class creates the window and widgets, and the play_game and reset methods handle the game logic and GUI updates.

Future Improvements

This game is a very basic implementation of an AI algorithm. There are many more advanced algorithms that could be used to make the AI player more challenging. Additionally, the GUI could
be improved with more advanced widgets and styling.
