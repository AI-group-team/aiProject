Here's how the program works:
The user is prompted to enter a string, which is stored in the string variable.
An empty dictionary called freq is created to store the frequency count of each character in the string.
A for loop iterates over each character in the string. For each character,
 it checks if it's already in the freq dictionary. If it is, it increments the count by 1. If it's not, 
it adds it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
Another for loop iterates over each key-value pair in the freq dictionary. 
It prints out the count and the character, separated by an apostrophe s.
