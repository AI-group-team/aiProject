This is a simple implementation of the popular Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python.

To play the game, simply run the rps.py file in your terminal or IDE of choice.

The game will prompt the user to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and then randomly select an option for the computer player.

The game will then determine the winner according to the standard rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors and display the results.

Enjoy playing the game!
